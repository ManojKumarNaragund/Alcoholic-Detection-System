# Alcoholic-Detection-System
This GitHub repository hosts the source code and schematics for building a straightforward alcohol detector using an Arduino microcontroller and an MQ-3 sensor. With the goal of preventing drinking and driving accidents, this project provides a practical solution for monitoring alcohol levels in the immediate surroundings.

Features:

Utilizes an MQ-3 sensor: The MQ-3 sensor is chosen for its effectiveness in detecting alcohol vapors.
Arduino compatibility: The project is implemented using Arduino microcontrollers, making it accessible to a wide range of enthusiasts and developers.
Dual output modes: The sensor provides both analog and digital outputs, allowing for flexibility in integration and data processing.
Voltage amplification: The LM393 IC is employed to amplify the voltage signal from the sensor to a detectable level, enhancing the sensitivity and accuracy of alcohol detection.
Adjustable amplification level: Potentiometers on the sensor enable users to fine-tune the amplification level according to specific requirements.
Wide range of applications: While the primary focus is on preventing drunk driving accidents, the alcohol detector can be applied in various settings where alcohol monitoring is necessary, such as industrial safety, breathalyzer testing, and personal health monitoring.
